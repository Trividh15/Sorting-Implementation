This repository contains the implementation of Quick Sort in C, C++, Java and Python.
The cpp file has the complete discription of the Quick Sort algorithm as comments.
You can use the cpp file to read the comments and understand the significance of each step.
In case you don't practice C++ then read the comments and refer to the file of your preferable language because all the other files are merely a translation of C++  code.
