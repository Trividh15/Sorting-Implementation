This repository contains sub-directories with the name of different sorting algorithms.
I have tried to share the implementation of all these types of sorting in 4 different programing languages.
The sorting algorithms are implemented in C, C++, Java and Python.
A sorting algorithm has the same concept for its implementation in any programming language, the only change there are the different syntaxes of those languages. 
Some languages turn out to provide easier implementation of sorting method because of its in-built methods and functions.
I hope you find this repository helpful, Thanks for reading!
